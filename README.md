BTC TECHNICAL MATERIALS SEARCH

This project will serve as a search engine for searching Bitcoin technical related materials. It will aggregate all Bitcoin related materials and performs search on those materials instead of going through thousands of unrelated Google search results. 

It will classify materials according to:

- Relevance
- Domains
- Tags
- Authors


---

## Getting started 
The search engine is built using ReactJS and Python. Dependencies include `Node v16.13.0`.


## Installation

One can leverage [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node before proceeding to start the application by running the following commands:

```bash
# Run this to install Node 16.13.0
nvm install 16.13.0

# Run this to use the installed Node version 
nvm use 16.13.0
```

The README assumes that you have generated this code from within the App Search dashboard.

Run the following commands to start this application:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:adamjonas/btc-engine-1-react-demo-ui.git
# Run the `cd` command to change the current directory to the
# location of your downloaded project directory. Replace the path
# below with the actual path of your project.
cd ~/Projects/btc-engine-1-react-demo-ui.git

# Run this to set everything up
npm install

# Run this to start your application and open it up in a new browser window
npm start
```
